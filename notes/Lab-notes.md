I'm starting a notebook because I keep forgetting what I'm working on. Hopefully this will completement the git logs

Okay today I was able to update the `Ensemble` constructor function, and write a function in `explore-parameters.jl` that will generate an Ensemble and run the dynamics. I need to check for bugs and work on the visulation side now. 

I need to make sure to use `@quickactivate` with DrWatson otherwise saving does not work as expected.
